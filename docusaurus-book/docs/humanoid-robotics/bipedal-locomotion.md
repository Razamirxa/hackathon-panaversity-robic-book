# Bipedal Locomotion

Walking on two legs is one of robotics' hardest challenges.

## Gait Generation

- Inverse kinematics
- Trajectory optimization
- Reinforcement learning

## Control Methods

- ZMP control
- Model predictive control
- Learned policies

## Summary

Bipedal locomotion enables humanoids to navigate like humans.
