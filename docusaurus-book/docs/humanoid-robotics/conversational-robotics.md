# Conversational Robotics

Enable humanoids to communicate via speech.

## Speech Recognition

```python
# Using Whisper for speech-to-text
import whisper
model = whisper.load_model("base")
result = model.transcribe("audio.wav")
```

## Speech Synthesis

Text-to-speech for robot responses.

## Summary

Speech interfaces enable natural human-robot interaction.
