# Sim-to-Real Transfer

Bridge the gap between simulation and reality.

## Domain Randomization

- Randomize lighting, textures, physics
- Generate diverse training data
- Improve generalization

## Reality Gap Challenges

- Material properties
- Sensor noise
- Contact dynamics

## Summary

Domain randomization enables sim-to-real transfer.
