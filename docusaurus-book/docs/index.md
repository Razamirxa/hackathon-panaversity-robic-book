# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This course bridges the gap between digital AI (the brain) and physical robotics (the body), enabling you to apply AI knowledge to control humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world environments.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to AI systems that operate in and interact with the physical world. Unlike traditional AI that exists purely in the digital realm, Physical AI must understand and navigate physical constraints, sensor data, and real-world uncertainties.

## About This Textbook

This textbook covers the complete stack for building intelligent physical AI systems:

- **Robotic Nervous System**: ROS 2 for robot communication and control
- **Digital Twin**: Gazebo and Unity for physics simulation
- **AI-Robot Brain**: NVIDIA Isaac™ for perception and decision-making
- **Vision-Language-Action**: Multimodal models for understanding and acting
- **Humanoid Robotics**: Bipedal locomotion, manipulation, and human-robot interaction

## Course Structure

This textbook is organized into 7 major chapters covering 12 weeks of instruction:

1. **Course Overview**: Learning outcomes, weekly breakdown, prerequisites
2. **Hardware & Infrastructure**: Workstation specs, edge kits, lab options, cloud alternatives
3. **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: Installation, nodes/topics, services, navigation, debugging
4. **Digital Twin Simulation**: Gazebo, Unity, URDF modeling, sensor integration, physics
5. **NVIDIA Isaac Platform**: Isaac Sim, Omniverse, robot brain AI, perception, SLAM
6. **Vision-Language-Action**: VLA models, multimodal learning, action primitives
7. **Humanoid Robotics**: Locomotion, manipulation, balance, conversational AI, HRI design

## Who This Is For

This textbook is designed for:

- **Students** learning about robotics, AI, and embodied intelligence
- **Instructors** teaching Physical AI and robotics courses
- **Researchers** working on humanoid robots and physical AI systems
- **Engineers** building real-world robotic applications

## Prerequisites

Before starting this textbook, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python 3.8+ or C++17)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts
- Access to appropriate hardware (see Hardware & Infrastructure chapter)

## Learning Approach

Each chapter includes:

- **Learning Objectives**: Clear goals for what you'll master
- **Conceptual Explanations**: Understanding the "why" behind technologies
- **Code Examples**: Practical, runnable code with expected output
- **Hands-On Labs**: Weekly lab activities to apply knowledge
- **Further Reading**: Resources for deeper exploration

## Getting Started

Begin with the [Course Overview](./course-overview/learning-outcomes.md) to understand the complete learning path, then proceed to [Hardware & Infrastructure](./hardware-infrastructure/index.md) to set up your development environment.

**Let's build intelligent robots that can see, understand, and act in the physical world!**
